# Hazir – Service Provider App 🤝📱

**Hazir** is a dual-role service marketplace where users can act as both **service providers** and **service seekers**. Built with Firebase and Kotlin, the platform allows users to create gigs, communicate via in-app chat, place orders, complete services, and leave reviews — all within a secure mobile environment.
